This will search for some room. It requries that the state is untouched, i.e. either the first call or after a reset_locale_search().

args:
local   The room to check availability for.

return  A selenium item that has all sub-divs that has the scheduled events. This is basically jibbrish that selenium can handle.

Once we have gotten all the scheduled items we basically just want to get the title (start/end time) info.
I iterate throuhgh all possible weekDivs (each day) and then add them to a 'keeper'.

args:
weekDiv     This is the selenium object that has the scheduled events (see return of fresh_get_locale()).

return      An array of ALL info for the scheduled events. I.e. Course code, attendees, time-interval etc.
